<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>Introduction:
This page will serve as my personal website to host the various projects, files, and links to other
    pages that can store files which are not supported to be displayed on this site. The content here may include 
    other instances of the projects which may feature their titles and descriptions, methodologies, and summaries.
    This is not an exhaustive list, as further details may be added or removed for the sake of organization and 
    cleanliness of the page itself. As always, it will be a work in progress. If you ended up here, you were most 
    likely directed through personal sharing of the page, and I thank you for viewing, browsing, and hopefully 
    enjoying this portfolio.</p>
