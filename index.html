    <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> This page will serve as my personal website to host the various projects, files, and links to other pages that can store files which are not supported to be displayed on this site.</p>
    <p>The content here may include other instances of the projects which may feature their titles and descriptions, methodologies, and summaries. This is not an exhaustive list, as further details may be added or removed for the sake of organization and cleanliness of the page itself.</p>
    <p>As always, it will be a work in progress. If you ended up here, you were most likely directed through personal sharing of the page, and I thank you for viewing, browsing, and hopefully enjoying this portfolio.</p>
