    <h1>Welcome to My Intelligence/Data Analysis Portfolio</h1>
    <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> This page will serve as my personal website to host the various projects, files, and links to other pages that can store files which are not supported to be displayed on this site.</p>
    <p>The content here may include other instances of the projects which may feature their titles and descriptions, methodologies, and summaries. This is not an exhaustive list, as further details may be added or removed for the sake of organization and cleanliness of the page itself.</p>
    <p>As always, it will be a work in progress. If you ended up here, you were most likely directed through personal sharing of the page, and I thank you for viewing, browsing, and hopefully enjoying this portfolio.</p>
    <p><strong>02/05/2025 Project 1 Update:</strong> My first project will aim to create an industry-standard Intelligence Report. To do this, I have selected the <strong>Gallipoli Campaign of World War I</strong> to focus on for this project. I have outlined the steps that are needed to accomplish this below.</p>
    <p class="step">Step 1:</p>
    <p>Gather OSINT from news sources, government reports, open-source platforms, and organize data.</p>
    <p class="step">Step 2:</p>
    <p>Structure report via IPB Method (Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield) by defining Operational Environment (OE), describing battlefield effects, evaluating threats, and determining Course(s) of Action (COA).</p>
    <p class="step">Step 3:</p>
    <p>Include assessments, COAs, and gaps in intelligence to provide a clear analysis, outlining various scenarios and outcomes, risks, and responsiveness, and address insufficient intelligence by recommendations to address the gaps.</p>
    <p class="step">Step 4:</p>
    <p>Final review and editing of report through proofreading, ensuring logically supported analysis via the available data, and possible peer review.</p>
