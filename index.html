    <h1>Welcome to My Intelligence/Data Analysis Portfolio</h1>
    <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> This page will serve as my personal website to host the various projects, files, and links to other pages that can store files which are not supported to be displayed on this site.</p>
    <p>The content here may include other instances of the projects which may feature their titles and descriptions, methodologies, and summaries. This is not an exhaustive list, as further details may be added or removed for the sake of organization and cleanliness of the page itself.</p>
    <p>As always, it will be a work in progress. If you ended up here, you were most likely directed through personal sharing of the page, and I thank you for viewing, browsing, and hopefully enjoying this portfolio.</p>
    <p><strong>02/05/2025 Project 1 Update:</strong> My first project will aim to create an industry-standard Intelligence Report. To do this, I have selected the <strong>Gallipoli Campaign of World War I</strong> to focus on for this project. I have outlined the steps that are needed to accomplish this below.</p>
    <p class="step">Step 1:</p>
    <p>Gather OSINT from news sources, government reports, open-source platforms, and organize data.</p>
    <p class="step">Step 2:</p>
    <p>Structure report via IPB Method (Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield) by defining Operational Environment (OE), describing battlefield effects, evaluating threats, and determining Course(s) of Action (COA).</p>
    <p class="step">Step 3:</p>
    <p>Include assessments, COAs, and gaps in intelligence to provide a clear analysis, outlining various scenarios and outcomes, risks, and responsiveness, and address insufficient intelligence by recommendations to address the gaps.</p>
    <p class="step">Step 4:</p>
    <p>Final review and editing of report through proofreading, ensuring logically supported analysis via the available data, and possible peer review.</p>
    <p><strong>02/15/2025 Project 1 Update:</strong> I am going to pivot this project to be a little more data science oriented. May will return to the previous project's initial tasks, but I have gathered a few projects that may be worth undertaking, and I want to keep track of them here.</p>
    <p>Project 1 will be on hold indefinitely. New projects that will take precedence are <strong>Developing enhanced AI filtering for current Applicant Tracking Systems</strong> that are currently industry standard. Another work in progress might be developing an application to scrape Twitter users/posts to <strong>determine the probability of human vs. AI accounts.</strong></p>
    <p>However that would require more access to the APIs that are very expensive and maybe not a project that will be given a chance due to low interest in investors.</p>
    <p>The other fun little thing I would like to attempt would be to <strong>create a predictive sports model</strong> with great accuracy.</p>
    <p>Keeping track of these will be difficult because one day I might decide to work a little on one and a little on another, but I will always try to keep them organized and up to date with the progress. I have outlined very primitive technical plans for each one, so that's the start. Momentum is there, it's just logistical info that needs to be sorted before being able to really dive in deep into any one of them which is what I will be attempting to accomplish today. The focus right now is to find and secure access for popular ATS APIs to utilize for this project.</p>
